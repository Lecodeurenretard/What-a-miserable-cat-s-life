This file simply list the progression of patches in this minor version.


0.2.0:
	Modified `Animal.move()` to set a new destination if the current one is reached and added an alternative `Animal.moveToDest()` which moves toward the destination and does not set a new one.
	`Animal::getSpriteFolder()` and `Animal::getSpriteBase()` are now static constants instead of static methods and got renamed to `Animal::spriteFolder` and `Animal::spriteBase`.
	The destination threshold of `Animal.isAtDest()` is now easily customisable and is dependant of the speed of the animal.
	Created the `Dog` class and added sprites.
	Modified .gitignore to include templates for creating new Cat and Dog sprites.
	Cleaning images.cpp before adding new headers in imgToHex
