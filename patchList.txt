This file simply list the progression of patches

0.1.2.1:
	added destination field in `Animal` & a few incomplete related methods
	added `Vector` struct
	added a lot of new methods for `Pos`:
		`inBound` constructor
		`shift()` && `shiftSelf()`
		`lerp()` (static)
		convertion to `Vector`
		`ORIGIN` and `SCREEN_CENTER` constant static fields
	moved `WIN_WIDTH` & `WIN_HEIGHT` to Utilities.hpp and added doc
	removed inheritance of `std::exeption` for `Warning` because useless with the newly added method `print()`
	added `STYLE_WARNING` in color constants
	`vout` is now a global object in main.cpp
	`saveImageToFile()` now return a `bool` and doesn't throw anything
	added a second lighter version of `saveImageToFile()`
	`quit()` takes now default arguments
	changing error messages
	cleaning

0.1.2.1 bis:
	added backtick in this file
	added cmake-clean in this project

0.1.2.2:
	Renamed `Animal::display()` by `Animal::draw()`.
	A lot of changes for the `Vector` struct:
		`x` and `y` are now floats for more precision in calculations.
		`lerp()` has been finished and a bunch new functions are added:
			A constructor which takes `SDL_FPoints`
			`opposite()` which returns the opposites vector.
			`norm()` and `withNorm()` which respectively return the norm (length) of the vector and sets it to a value.
			`unit()` returns the unit vector with the same direction as the current one.
			`draw()` a debugging function that draws the vector in a renderer as an arrow.
			`rotate()` rotates a vector.
			`dotProduct()` returns a number indicating how much two vectors are similar.
			`lerpNoRestrict()` by default `lerp()` restrict $t$ in $0 <= t <= 1$
			`+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators are added with their corresponding assignement operators.
			The constants `UP` and `RIGHT` are defined.
			`[[ nodiscard ]]` have been added on all operators and `lerp`
