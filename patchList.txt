This file simply list the progression of patches in this minor version.

0.1.2.1:
	added destination field in `Animal` & a few incomplete related methods
	added `Vector` struct
	added a lot of new methods for `Pos`:
		`inBound` constructor
		`shift()` && `shiftSelf()`
		`lerp()` (static)
		convertion to `Vector`
		`ORIGIN` and `SCREEN_CENTER` constant static fields

	moved `WIN_WIDTH` & `WIN_HEIGHT` to Utilities.hpp and added doc
	removed inheritance of `std::exeption` for `Warning` because useless with the newly added method `print()`
	added `STYLE_WARNING` in color constants
	`vout` is now a global object in main.cpp
	`saveImageToFile()` now return a `bool` and doesn't throw anything
	added a second lighter version of `saveImageToFile()`
	`quit()` takes now default arguments
	changing error messages
	cleaning

0.1.2.1 bis:
	added backtick in this file
	added cmake-clean in this project

0.1.2.2:
	Renamed `Animal::display()` by `Animal::draw()`.
	A lot of changes for the `Vector` struct:
		`x` and `y` are now floats for more precision in calculations.
		`lerp()` has been finished and a bunch new functions are added:
			A constructor which takes `SDL_FPoints`
			`opposite()` which returns the opposites vector.
			`norm()` and `withNorm()` which respectively return the norm (length) of the vector and sets it to a value.
			`unit()` returns the unit vector with the same direction as the current one.
			`draw()` a debugging function that draws the vector in a renderer as an arrow.
			`rotate()` rotates a vector.
			`dotProduct()` returns a number indicating how much two vectors are similar.
			`lerpNoRestrict()` by default `lerp()` restrict $t$ in $0 <= t <= 1$
			`+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators are added with their corresponding assignement operators.
			The constants `UP` and `RIGHT` are defined.
			`[[ nodiscard ]]` have been added on all operators and `lerp`

0.1.2.3:
	A lot of changes for the `Animal` class:
		Declared a new macro: `ANIMAL_SPRITE_SIZE` that contain the size of sprites.
		Moved the `speed` field from `Cat` to `Animal`.
		The 3 constructors of `Animal` takes the speed as a parameter.
		`increaseSpeed()` too.
		Added `isAtDest()` which returns if the Animal is at destination.
		`draw()` takes now a boolean to draw the speed vector (for debugging).
		`setSprite()`, `Animal::Animal(Pos, uint)` now works.
		`move()`, which was only declared is now defined
	`Cat::setSprite()` is also corrected.

	Several changes for the `Pos` struct:
		`pos_t` now copies `float`.
		Added 3 constructors for converting `Vector`, `SDL_Point` and `SDL_FPoint` to `Pos`.
		The `inBounds()` method is splitted in two different one: 
			`isInBounds()` which does the check and
			`createInBounds()` which creates the object.
		Added `==` and `!=` as default operators.
		Added convertion to `SDL_Point` and `SDL_FPoint`.
		Removed `vectorToPos()` because it got replaced by a constructor.
		Added `round(Pos)` which returns a `Pos` with rounded `x` and `y` (since those are now floats).
		`lerp()` and `operator Vector()` are now nodiscard.
	
	A few changes were done to `Vector`:
		Added `==` and `!=` as default operators.
		Added `LEFT` and `DOWN` const static fileds to `Vectors`.
		Modified `UP` and `DOWN` because SDL coordonate system is flipped compared to a classic math plane.
		Added check before drawing, if we try to draw the null vector, the program only draws a dot.
	Some changes were made to the `VerboseStream` class:

		Modifed the type of `stream` to now be a pointer.
		Renamed `flushed` to `printHeading`.
		Added the `=` operator as private.
		Added the default copy constructor.
		Added the `heading` static constant which is the text that the default operator `<<` handler prints.
		Added 2 manipulators:
			`noHeading()`: Forbid printing the heading.
			`newLine()`: Prints a new line, bypass any restriction done by the `<<` operator handler.
	
	Modified the doc:
		Put the `Building from source` section in a newly created `Modding`.
		Added a `Adding custom sprites` section in `Modding`.
		Added a line to separate the footer from the last section.

0.1.2.4:
	The `Warning` class  is now a stream handler and got renamed as `WarningStream` because the way I'm using it can be simplified to a stream.
	Added `WarningStream` and `VerboseStream` to the doc.
	`ostream_manipulator` is now defined in Imports.hpp.
	Minor changes to `Verbose`.
	Edited some comments.
	Spaced the lines of this file to make it easier to read and moved the 83 line (on `heading`) to be the 79th one.

0.1.2.push:
	Added " in this minor version." at the end of line 1.
	Fixed bugs introduced by `pos_t` becoming a struct:
		A `pos_t` now cannot be negative.
		Added operators assgnements operators (except `=`).
	
	Added constants `WIN_MIN` and `WIN_MAX` which represents the respectively the smallest and largest position on the screen.
	Moved `DESIRED_FPS` to Utilities.hpp and added documentation so functions can rely on the framerate.
	Renamed `Animal::draw()`'s `drawSpeedVec` argument to `drawInfos` since all it lets the function draw the speed vector and the destination.
	Simplified calculations in `Pos::shift`, calculations stays on `pos_t` instead of 64-bits integers and useless calculations are also removed.
	Added `Pos::draw()` which draws a cross at the position represented by the object.
	Fixed bug in CMakeLists.txt that forced the user to build in Debug mode.
	Added documentation where missing.
